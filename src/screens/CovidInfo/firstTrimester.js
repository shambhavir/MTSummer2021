              The first trimester, first twelve weeks or first three months, of your pregnancy is one of the most important stages of pregnancy for you as an expecting mother and your developing baby. Mothers who receive early and consistent prenatal care (PNC) have an increased likelihood of giving birth to a healthy baby.

              It is recommended by health care providers that mothers should begin their prenatal care in the first trimester itself. This is because right at the end of the first trimester, the baby will have developed all major organs and main body systems such as respiratory, circulatory, digestive, etc. The earliest stages are the most vulnerable for healthy development of the fetus. {'\n'}{'\n'} If you're trying to get pregnant, pregnancy tests can be taken on a regular basis. If you are not trying to get pregnant or do not have access to a pregnancy test, there are a few symptoms to look for such as: fatgiue, food cravings, frequent urination, morning sickness (nausea and vomiting), bloating (swelling of the abdomen). If you have any concerns, always reach out to your doctor. You can take first stage assesment at a doctor's office and get more information about your possible pregnancy. Lastly, there should also be a thorough evaluation of your and your partner's medical history, a physical exam, and an examination to check the status of the fetus.
